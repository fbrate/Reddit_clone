<h2>Brief explanation of each of the microservices</h2>
<h4>UserService</h4>
Database for User(Authenticaton)

Then it will map the data to JSON and share it to the AuthenticationAndFrontEndService for login and some id verification.

ForumService which creates a User copy object which has the same id. This is to ensure that each service corresponing ids in both services to keep posts linked to the corrct User.

	authenticaiton is required.

**Dependencies**
	
	
* Need to fetch authentication data from UserService
* Needs to fetch post,channel, forumUser data from ForumService
	
	
**Functionality:**
	
*  Create Account.
*  Login, Logout.
*  Session Management.
*  Microservices communication using REST APIs.
* Main Page showing all posts(login not necesarry).
*  User can see two pages: 
  *  All posts: Posts from all users appear here.
  *  Channel posts: Posts from subscribed channels appear here.
*  A channel is like a forum topic(example: bitcoin, arts). Each posts should belong to a channel.
